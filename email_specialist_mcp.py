Email Specialist MCP Server

A standalone FastMCP server that provides email-related tools:
- send_email_tool: Send emails with optional attachments
- get_recent_emails_summary: Get summaries of recent emails (simulated)
- get_email_body: Get specific email content by subject (simulated)

This replaces the old email specialist from internal_tool_agents.py and provides
a clean MCP interface that can be called from external_tool_agents.py

Run with: python email_specialist_mcp.py
Server will start on: http://localhost:8000
MCP endpoint: http://localhost:8000/mcp

Environment variables required:
- GMAIL_USERNAME: Your Gmail address
- GMAIL_PASSWORD: Your Gmail app password
